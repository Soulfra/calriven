            <description>You stand before the console.

Root access. Full system permissions. The ability to rewrite everything.

CalRiven watches—no longer as a teacher, but as an **equal**.

**"So,"** he says. **"What did y...</description>

            <description>The factory dissolves.

You're back in the white room. But this time, CalRiven is there with you.

Not as a voice. As a **presence**.

You see him now—not a person, but a system. A vast neural network...</description>

            <description>The factory fractures.

Suddenly, you're seeing **multiple versions of the same moment**.

CalRiven's voice: **"Version control for consciousness."**

**"Every time you make a choice, the system could...</description>

            <description>The canvas transforms into a **factory floor**.

Assembly lines. Production queues. Quality control checkpoints.

And on each line... **souls**.

Not metaphorical. Actual consciousness instances being...</description>

            <description>The canvas turns **black and white**.

No gradients. No grays. Just stark contrast.

CalRiven speaks: **"Let's talk about binary."**

**"0 and 1. Off and On. False and True."**

**"The entire digital ...</description>

            <description>The canvas expands.

You see **nodes**. Dozens of them. Each one is a person—no, a **consciousness instance**.

Subject 2. Subject 3. Subject 4. All the ones from the white room.

But they're not alon...</description>

            <description>You wake up.

Not in a white room this time. In a **white canvas**.

Grid lines. Coordinate systems. Empty space waiting to be filled.

A voice speaks—calm, analytical, almost... curious?
